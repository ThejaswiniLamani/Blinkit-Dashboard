Title: Showcasing My Blinkit Sales Dashboard Project

I’m thrilled to share a recent project where I utilized Power BI to create an interactive sales dashboard for Blinkit. Here’s a detailed look using the STAR method:

Situation:
I embarked on a project to create a comprehensive sales dashboard. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with Power BI and improve my data visualization skills.

Task:
My task was to design an intuitive and informative dashboard that would provide valuable insights into Blinkit’s sales data, including total sales, average sales, average ratings, number of items, and various breakdowns by item type, outlet size, and location.

Action:

Data Preparation: Cleaned and prepared the dataset to ensure accuracy and relevance.
Design and Layout: Designed the dashboard layout to include key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive elements.
Visualization: Created various charts and graphs to visualize total sales, average sales, and trends over the years.
Interactivity: Added filters for outlet location, size, and item type to allow for interactive data exploration.
Insights Extraction: Analyzed the data to identify top-performing categories, outlet types, and historical sales trends.
Result:

Successfully created a dynamic and interactive sales dashboard that showcases $1.2M in total sales.
The dashboard provides a clear breakdown of sales by item type, outlet size, and location, aiding in better decision-making.
Improved my skills in data visualization and gained a deeper understanding of Power BI’s capabilities.
Received positive feedback from peers and mentors for the clarity and comprehensiveness of the dashboard.
I am excited to apply these skills in real-world scenarios and continue growing in the field of data analytics.
